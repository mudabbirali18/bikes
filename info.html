    <h1>ABOUT EV BIKES</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Electric bikes</strong> , commonly known as e-bikes, are bicycles that feature an integrated electric
        motor to assist with
        pedaling. Unlike fully <b> electric scooters or motorcycles</b>, <abbr title="Electric bikes">e-bikes</abbr>
        still require the rider to pedal, but the motor
        provides an extra boost, making it easier to ride uphill, travel longer distances, or commute without arriving
        overly <i>tired or sweaty</i>. Most e-bikes are powered by lithium-ion batteries and can usually travel between
        20 to
        70 miles on a single charge, depending on the model, terrain, and level of motor assistance used. There are
        several types of e-bikes available, including pedal-assist models, which only activate the motor when the rider
        is pedaling, and throttle-based models, which can provide power without pedaling. This flexibility has made
        e-bikes increasingly popular among commuters, recreational riders, and even delivery workers.</p>

    <p>One of the main reasons for the growing popularity of e-bikes is their potential to offer a more <em>sustainable
            and
            convenient alternative to cars</em> , especially in urban areas.882,000 kg CO<sub>2</sub> avoided With
        rising concerns about climate change, traffic
        congestion, and the costs of fuel and vehicle maintenance, many people are looking for cleaner and more
        efficient ways to get around. E-bikes produce zero direct emissions and take up far less space than cars, making
        them ideal for city commuting. They also enable riders to bypass traffic jams and often have access to bike
        lanes or paths where cars cannot go. Some cities and governments have introduced incentives and subsidies to
        encourage e-bike adoption, while others have created bike-share programs that include electric options. As a
        result, e-bikes are playing an increasingly important role in reshaping urban transportation systems and
        reducing dependence on fossil fuels.<br>

    <p>Battery need NH<sup>4</sup>which help to run. the rise of e-bikes also brings new challenges and considerations.
        For one, the upfront cost of an
        e-bike is typically higher than that of a traditional bicycle, often ranging from several hundred to several
        thousand dollars. Additionally, e-bike batteries require regular charging and proper care to maintain their
        longevity and performance. Safety is another concern, as faster speeds and the growing number of e-bikes on
        roads and bike paths can lead to conflicts with pedestrians, cars, or traditional cyclists. In response, many
        countries have introduced regulations to govern the use of e-bikes, such as speed limits, helmet requirements,
        and restrictions on where they can be ridden. Despite these challenges, advancements in battery technology,
        improved infrastructure, and growing public interest suggest that e-bikes will continue to gain traction and
        become a key part of the future of personal transportation.<q>E-bikes aren't just bikes; theyâ€™re a gateway to
            freedom, fun, and sustainable travel.</q></P> <tr>
